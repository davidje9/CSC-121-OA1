print(f"\tWhile cost and time prohibitive, I'd prefer to travel by {modes_of_transportation [0]} if going long distances. Maybe I can save some money and do those trips on a {modes_of_transportation[1]} instead.\n\n\tIt would also be nice to own a {modes_of_transportation[2]} for big jobs in short distances to home. But the biggest investment in transportation I can manage right now might be an {modes_of_transportation[-1]}.")
